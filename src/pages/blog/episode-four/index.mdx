### ...Of Sharks And Sahuagin

Vherika having hired a motley crew of misfits and ne'er-do-wells as well as a ship, the Discovery, set forth on her mission. Not too long into their voyage on the open sea, a great portal opened up in the sky, whereupon a mysterious stranger fell through and splashed upon the waters below. The crew were understandably shocked and then shocked again as the tell tale signs of a shark appeared into view heading its way over to the mysterious stranger. The mysterious stranger, completely unaware of the danger vastly approaching them.

Boudreaux Babinoux (BB) and Chrys take one of the rowboats to try and mount a rescue. Tor attaches a rope to the ship and tosses it out to the swimming stranger. They all call out to him to alert him about the impending threat of the shark, at which point the stranger does take notice, and he teleports to the ship just after the ship's pilot, Mary Fowler, is knocked overboard by a previously unforeseen band of sahuagin that has started their attack.

Chrys rescues Mary while BB jumps up to the ship to fight the sahuagin. The sahuagin climbs up to attack Vherika, who had shot him. The other is knocked by Tor's shillelagh, then jumps overboard to escape. The stranger shoots fire the the sahuagin attacking Vherika but misses. Chrys aims true and shoots down Vherika's attacker.

With the sahuagin ambush dispatched, Vherika questions the stranger. The party learns that the stranger's name is Arentha'vas and he is an elf from a distant plane. While this is happening, Tor and BB manage to befriend the shark, whom they find out is named Finn and was unknowingly being controlled by the sahuagin.

### Rumble in the Jungle

Later in the day, the party with the new found stranger, Arentha'vas, makes landfall on the beach of their destination. As they explore for a few more hours, Veherika realizes that the party is not alone. Her keen hearing catches the sounds of a number of medium-sized reptiles following them. The party continues to move, although more cautiously, through the jungles.

With some assistance from Arentha'vas and his familiar, the party hatches a plan to go deeper into the jungle on the following day. On the next day, they venture out from the Discovery and make landfall once more. After a few hours, they realize they are again being followed by what appears to be several of these previously unseen reptiles.

The party devises a plan: Arentha'vas volunteers to be used as bait while the rest of the party awaits in an ambush near a ravine. While all the party manages to hide, Tor gets distracted and forgets. The velociraptors attacked, but the party - well, all except Tor - were ready to pounce.

Vherika took one out with a mighty shot. One unfortunate 'raptor ran into BB and was blocked by his shield. A second attack almost lands on BB but Arentha'vas' strange spell alters events and its claw fails to make purchase. BB and Chrys slay the beast. Arentha'vas was completely untouched in the encounter, due to his powerful magics, as the party quickly managed to dispatch the entire herd? flock? pod? dashboard? of velociraptors.

After the encounter, Tor manages to lead the party across the ravine and to the 'raptor's lair, whereupon the party finds a few ancient coins, three potions of healing, a silver and lapis bracelet, and a well-preserved satchel containing a spell book!

An additional hour or more of trek later, the party comes across a clearing with their goal in their sight: the coral crown. The only thing standing between them and their objective are but five "cattle-like" armored reptiles.
